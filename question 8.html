  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first paragraph. It is indented using non-breaking spaces. HTML does not recognize spaces typed directly in the code, so we use `&nbsp;` to manually add space at the beginning.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second paragraph. Like the first one, it is indented with `&nbsp;`. This gives the paragraph a neat and formatted appearance for visual clarity.</p>
